      <h3 class="page__h3">Value Based Grants</h3>
      <p class="page__text">
        The Interfraternity Council (IFC) offers Value-Based Grants (VBGs) to promote the core values of its
        member fraternities. These grants aim to reimburse fraternity expenses for events that align with their
        mission and values, including philanthropy, fundraising, or service activities. The funds are distributed
        twice per semester, with each request reviewed by the IFC VP of Philanthropy, VP of Finance, and the Executive
        Board. Chapters may apply for reimbursement by submitting an application form and providing itemized receipts.
        Funding requests must meet specific guidelines, which can be found in the bylaws, and a cap of $1,500 per chapter
        per semester. Any individual event that costs more than $500 is subject to less reimbursement for costs as
        specified in the bylaws. If your fraternity is interested in applying, please submit the VBG application form
        through the link below. Please reach out with any questions or concerns.

      <h3 class="page__h3">ChiliFest</h3>
      <p class="page__text">
        ChiliFest is the Interfraternity Council’s signature philanthropy event—a campus-wide chili cook-off that brings together IFC chapters, students, alumni, and neighbors for great food and an even better cause. Launched in Fall 2025 as our inaugural ChiliFest, the event kicked off a new IFC tradition of service, community, and friendly competition.
        Every ticket and sponsorship directly fuels IFC’s charitable impact. Thanks to the incredible support of our chapters, sponsors, and volunteers, the inaugural ChiliFest raised $2,228 this year—funds that help power meaningful initiatives in our community.
        Want to get involved next time? Form a team, volunteer on event day, or partner with us as a sponsor. Reach out to the IFC Philanthropy team to learn how you can be part of the next ChiliFest.
