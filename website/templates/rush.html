                Rush is your chance to explore the incredibly diverse world of fraternities on campus. Think of it as a 
                week-long introduction to the unique brotherhoods that make up our Greek community. It's a time to meet 
                new people, attend fun events, and discover which chapter feels like home.  
            </p>
            <p class="page__text">

                    <p class="page__text">
                        Rush is all about finding a fraternity that fits your 
                        personality and values. Be genuine when meeting 
                        members—they want to get to know the real you, not a 
                        version you think they want.

                    <h4 class="page__h4">Ask Questions</h4>
                    <p class="page__text">
                        Don't hesitate to ask about chapter values, activities, 
                        academics, and what makes their brotherhood unique. This 
                        shows you're genuinely interested and helps you make an 
                        informed decision.

                    <p class="page__text">
                        The more events you attend, the better you'll understand 
                        each chapter's culture. It also gives you more 
                        opportunities to connect with members and other 
                        recruits.

                    <p class="page__text">
                        You might have preconceived ideas about certain 
                        fraternities, but every chapter is different. Keep an 
                        open mind—you could find your perfect fit in an 
                        unexpected place.

                    <h4 class="page__h4">Dress Appropriately</h4>
                    <p class="page__text">
                        While most events are casual, others may call for 
                        business casual attire. Pay attention to dress 
                        codes and aim to make a good impression without 
                        overthinking it. We recommend a collared shirt as a good 
                        sweet spot for rushing around.

                        Rush can be a busy process, so stay organized and 
                        prioritize going to the fraternities you feel the best 
                        connections with. This ensures you make the most of your 
                        experience without feeling overwhelmed.

                        Engaging in conversations with active members is one of 
                        the best ways to get a feel for a fraternity. Ask about 
                        their experiences, why they joined, and what keeps them 
                        involved.

                        Choose a fraternity that aligns with your goals and 
                        values.

                        Remember, the recruitment process is mutual. Focus on 
                        finding a chapter where you feel comfortable and 
                        confident. If it's meant to be, it'll happen!

            <h3 class="page__h3">Financial Expectations</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                Joining a fraternity comes with financial responsibilities, but 
                costs vary across chapters. We encourage open conversations with 
                chapter members to better understand their specific financial 
                expectations, especially if you have concerns about 
                affordability. However, joining a fraternity with housing and 
                meal plan can be several thousand dollar less expensive than 
                on- or off-campus housing in the long run. 

            </p>
            <p class="page__text">
                A membership fee of $20 will appear on student Bursar accounts 
                at the beginning of the Fall and Spring semesters after the 
                semester of your initiation. The Fraternity/Sorority Membership 
                Fee is a Georgia Tech fee in addition to any chapter dues 
                students will be assessed through their own organization.

            <h3 class="page__h3">You Got a Bid! What next?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                IFC leaders will be available throughout the entire process for 
                coaching and general guidance. If a student receives a bid and 
                wishes to continue to visit other chapters, it is OK to inform 
                the chapter issuing the bid that he wants to visit other 
                chapters before making a final decision. Once accepting a bid, 
                the student will need to complete the 
                <a href="https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/600085" class="page__link">Georgia Tech New Member Form</a> 
                within 24 hours. If a student accepts a bid but still has other 
                invitations from other chapters, the student must notify the 
                other chapters that he will not be attending.
            </p>
            <p class="page__text">
                To accept a bid, you usually just tell the chapter you would 
                like to accept. It's that easy! There are no financial 
                requirements for registration/recruitment and no obligation to 
                accept an invitation to membership of a chapter.

            <p class="page__text">
                Joining a fraternity offers opportunities for leadership, 
                lifelong friendships, community involvement, and personal 
                growth. It's a chance to be part of a brotherhood that supports 
                you academically, socially, and professionally.

            <h3 class="page__h3">Do I need to sign up for rush beforehand?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                Yes, you need to sign up for rush in advance to receive event 
                details and important updates about the recruitment process.  

            </p>
            <h3 class="page__h3">How do I know which fraternities to visit during rush?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                During rush, fraternities are open house. You should attend one 
                of the IFC tabling sessions to get a feel for where you might 
                want to go. This will help you decide which chapters align best 
                with your values and interests.   

            </p>
            <h3 class="page__h3">Do I have to accept a bid if I am offered one?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                No, receiving a bid is an invitation to join a fraternity, but 
                you are not required to accept it. Take your time to evaluate if 
                the fraternity is the right fit for you.
