                It's a time to meet new people, attend fun events, and discover 
                which chapter feels like home.

                    <p class="page__text">
                        Recruitment is all about finding a fraternity that fits 
                        your personality and values. Be genuine when meeting 
                        members—they want to get to know the real you, not a 
                        version you think they want.

                        Don't hesitate to ask about chapter values, activities, 
                        academics, and what makes their brotherhood unique. This 
                        shows you're genuinely interested and helps you make an 
                        informed decision.

                        The more events you attend, the better you'll understand 
                        each chapter's culture. It also gives you more 
                        opportunities to connect with members and other 
                        recruits.

            <h3 class="page__h3">Financial Expectations</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                Joining a fraternity comes with financial responsibilities, 
                but costs vary across chapters. We encourage open conversations 
                with chapter members to better understand their specific 
                financial expectations, especially if you have concerns about 
                affordability. First-year students are required to live on 
                campus, but after your first year, you may choose to live in 
                your fraternity's house, where the cost of living is typically 
                more affordable than on-campus housing. Additionally, financial 
                aid can often be applied to cover housing and membership dues.
            </p>
            <p class="page__text">
                A membership fee of $20 will appear on student Bursar accounts 
                at the beginning of the Fall and Spring semesters after the
                semester of your initiation. The Fraternity/Sorority Membership 
                Fee is a Georgia Tech fee in addition to any chapter dues 
                students will be assessed through their own organization.

            <h3 class="page__h3">You Got a Bid! What next?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                IFC leaders will be available throughout the entire process for 
                coaching and general guidance. If a student receives a bid and 
                wishes to continue to visit other chapters, it is OK to inform 
                the chapter issuing the bid that he wants to visit other 
                chapters before making a final decision. Once accepting a bid, 
                the student will need to complete the 
                <a href="https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/600085" class="page__link">Georgia Tech New Member Form</a> 
                within 24 hours. If a student accepts a bid but still has 
                other invitations from other chapters, the student must notify 
                the other chapters that he will not be attending. 
            </p>
            <p class="page__text">
                To accept a bid, you usually just say "I'd like to accept my bid". 
                It's that easy! There are no financial requirements for 
                registration/recruitment and no obligation to accept an 
                invitation to membership of a chapter. So, what are you waiting 
                for?

            <p class="page__text">
                Joining a fraternity offers opportunities for leadership, 
                lifelong friendships, community involvement, and personal 
                growth. It's a chance to be part of a brotherhood that supports 
                you academically, socially, and professionally.

            <h3 class="page__h3">Do I need to sign up for rush beforehand?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                Yes, you need to sign up for rush in advance to receive event 
                details and important updates about the recruitment process.
            </p>
            <h3 class="page__h3">How do I know which fraternities to visit during rush?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                During the recruitment process, fraternities will host various 
                events. You should attend as many events as possible to meet 
                different brothers and learn more about each chapter. This will 
                help you decide which chapter aligns best with your values and 
                interests.
            </p>
            <h3 class="page__h3">What should I wear to rush events?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                Dress codes can vary depending on the event. For most rush 
                events, smart-casual attire is appropriate. Some events may have 
                specific themes or dress codes, so be sure to check the details 
                for each event ahead of time.
            </p>
            <h3 class="page__h3">Do I have to accept a bid if I am offered one?</h3>
            <p class="page__text">
                No, receiving a bid is an invitation to join a fraternity, but 
                you are not required to accept it. Take your time to evaluate if 
                the fraternity is the right fit for you.
